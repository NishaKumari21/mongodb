📌 MongoDB: An Overview
🔹 What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like BSON (Binary JSON) format instead of traditional tables and rows like relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL). It is designed for handling large volumes of unstructured data with high scalability and flexibility.

🚀 Why Use MongoDB?
✅ Schema-less – No fixed structure; flexible data storage.
✅ Scalability – Easily handles large amounts of data using sharding (horizontal scaling).
✅ High Performance – Fast read/write operations compared to SQL databases.
✅ Document-Oriented – Stores data as documents (JSON-like objects) instead of tables.
✅ Easy Integration – Works well with Python, Flask, Django, Node.js, Java, etc.

🛠️ Key Features of MongoDB
Document-Based Storage 📄 – Data is stored in key-value pairs like JSON.

Indexing 🔍 – Fast query execution.

Replication 🔄 – Ensures high availability by creating multiple copies of data.

Sharding ⚡ – Distributes large datasets across multiple servers for better performance.

Aggregation Framework 📊 – Performs complex data analysis efficiently.
