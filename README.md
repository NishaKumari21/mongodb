ðŸ“Œ MongoDB: An Overview
ðŸ”¹ What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like BSON (Binary JSON) format instead of traditional tables and rows like relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL). It is designed for handling large volumes of unstructured data with high scalability and flexibility.

ðŸš€ Why Use MongoDB?
âœ… Schema-less â€“ No fixed structure; flexible data storage.
âœ… Scalability â€“ Easily handles large amounts of data using sharding (horizontal scaling).
âœ… High Performance â€“ Fast read/write operations compared to SQL databases.
âœ… Document-Oriented â€“ Stores data as documents (JSON-like objects) instead of tables.
âœ… Easy Integration â€“ Works well with Python, Flask, Django, Node.js, Java, etc.
